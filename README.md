# Motu Lani

![Motu Lani on different devices](readme_assets/images/responsive.png "Motu Lani on different devices")

The Motu Lani site was built to fufill the goals of two stakeholders, the owners of the Motu Lani Resort and consumers looking for a luxury vacation in the Pacific.

#### Motu Lani Owner Goals
- Increase bookings of Motu Lani Resort
- Increase the awareness of the resort with an online presence 
- Enhance the Motu Lani brand

#### Consumer Goals
- Learn about the Motu Lani resort and reasons for staying there
- Get a taste for the Motu Lani resort experience through the website's visual design 
- Make a booking request or contact the resort for information

## Design Process
This section outlines the design process and design thinking that occured when developing the Motu Lani site.

### UX Design

#### User stories

#### Competitor Analysis
To inform the design process I conducted a competitor analysis to inform the UX decision making. 

I looked at three competing island-resort websites. I performed three tasks and analysed what each website did well, didn't do well and if there were any pain points. 
The three tasks were:
1) Get a taste for the island-resort and to learn what kind of experience is offered based on how the website is presented.
2) Look for information about the accomodation
3) Make a booking request

#### Wireframes

[Desktop wireframes can be viewed here](readme_assets/desktop_wireframes.pdf)

[Mobile wireframes can be viewed here](readme_assets/mobile_wireframes.pdf)

#### High fidelity mockups
Before building Motu Lani mockups were made in Figma to work from.

### Visual Design

#### Moodboard

Before proceeding with creating the visual design I developed a [moodboard](readme_assets/moodboard.pdf) to draw inspiration from.

#### Colour Scheme

I took an image that represented the aesthetics I had in mind for the Motu Lani design system and uploaded to it Adobe Creative Cloud where a colour palette was then generated.

#### User Stories (optional for your project, but if you have a few you could add, then fantastic!)
    bulletpoint any user stories you have... "As a user, I would like to __________", etc.
#### Typography
Motu Lani makes use of three font families from [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com)

- [Charcuterie Contrast](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/charcuterie-contrast) is used for the logo
- [Granville](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/granville) is used for headings
- [DJR Forma Display](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/forma-djr-display) is used for paragraphs of text.

![Motu Lani Type](readme_assets/images/typography.png "Motu Lani Typography")

For the logo and headings I selected typefaces that had a Polynesian aesthetic. This wouldn't have been appropriate for paragraphs of text where legibility and uniformity is more important. 

## Features
    briefly explain the project
### Existing Features
    list out all of your project's features, and make sure to include a screenshot of each!!
### Features Left to Implement

- Currently the website has a booking form where users can submit booking requests. What would really enhance the project is to add a live booking system, where users can see dynamic pricing + availability and to make a booking themselves.
- Adding live chat functionality as a contact option.
- Website blog so that the Motu Lani resort can keep former and prospective guests updated on resort developments.

## Technologies Used

The Motu Lani projected was created using the following technologies:
- HTML - hypertext markup language is the standard language for designing files to be displayed in a web browser like Chrome or Safari. The most recent of HTML is version 5 which is what the Motu Lani project uses.

- CSS - cascading style sheets is a language used for styling a file written in a markup language like HTML.

- JavaScript (ES11) is a scripting language and one of the main technologies of web development. In Motu Lani it was used to implement a responsive mobile navigation system with animated burger icon, add a date to the copyright disclaimer and to conrol +/- form control. 

## Tools Used

- For writing code I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which I also for Git commands and pushing to GitHub

- [GitHub](https://github.com]) was used for hosting the online repository, it provides an online version of Git, a source code management tool.

- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com) was used to optimise all .JPEG and .PNG images used in the project to ensure efficient loading for the end user.

- Adobe Illustrator was used for vector graphic design, like for the logo, coral reef list bullets and map.

- [Figma](https://figma.com) was used to create high fidelity mockups before I started coding. 

- [Markdown Editor](https://apps.apple.com/ie/app/markdown-editor/id1458220908?mt=12) by Satoshi Iwaki was used for editing .MD files.

- [AutoPrefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) was used to add browser specifc prefixes.

## Testing
    "For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file."
## Deployment

The Motu Lani site was deployed to GitHub pages using the following steps:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
- The live link can be found at [https://ancfoster.github.io/Motu-Lani/index.html](https://ancfoster.github.io/Motu-Lani/index.html)

### Local Deployment
    document all the necessary steps someone else can take in order to make a local copy of your project, like cloning, forking, etc.
## Credits

### Content
I used an acessibiility guide provided by [Orange](https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/articles/accessible-svg/) on how to provide screen-reader support for an inline SVG.

I used a code snippet from StackOverflow user [Elad Amsaalem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11671100/scale-path-from-center) on how to properly scale an SVG path element.

```.scaled-path-svg { svg { path {transform-origin: center; transform: scale(1.1); } } } ```
