# Motu Lani
The Motu Lani site was built to fufill the goals of two stakeholders, the owners of the Motu Lani Resort and consumers looking for a luxury vacation in the Pacific.

#### Motu Lani Owner Goals
- Increase bookings of Motu Lani Resort
- Increase the awareness of the resort with an online presence 
- Enhance the Motu Lani brand

#### Consumer Goals
- Learn about the Motu Lani resort and reasons for staying there
- Get a taste for the Motu Lani resort experience through the website's visual design 
- Make a booking request or contact the resort for information

### Design Process
This section outlines the design process and design thinking that occured when developing the Motu Lani site.

#### Competitor Analysis
To inform the design process I conducted a competitor analysis to inform the UX decision making. 

I looked at three competing island-resort websites. I performed three tasks and analysed what each website did well, didn't do well and if there were any pain points. 
The three tasks were:
1) Get a taste for the island-resort and to learn what kind of experience is offered based on how the website is presented.
2) Look for information about the accomodation
3) Make a booking request

## Visual Design
#### Colour Scheme

I took an image that represented the aesthetics I had in mind for the Motu Lani design system and uploaded to it Adobe Creative Cloud where a colour palette was then generated.
